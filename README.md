# WavSurf

WavSurf is a sound file-sharing app which allows users to upload, browse, and download sound files. The frontend is built in React, while the backend is built with Node and utilizes PostgreSQL and AWS S3 for cloud storage.

## Using the site

This project is live at https://wavsurf.keganj.com. 

You can browse and download from the catalog of user-uploaded sound files by navigating to "Browse Sounds." The files are easily searchable with built-in search functionality, and you can click on a user's name to see a full list of sounds they've uploaded.

If you'd like to upload your own sounds, you can quickly create an account by navigating to "Sign Up." Then, you'll be able to easily upload your files from the main page.
